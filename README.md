## Tutorials

These tutorials were compiled as a way to understand Azure and how to use the internet of things. When you complete these tutorials you will be able to build your own IoT solution as presented in Azure's reference architectures.

You don't need to know much about Azure and only be familiar with the basics of coding to successfully get through this program. These tutorials focus on minimizing the cost of using Azure. You'll use PowerShell for cloud service management and Python for device coding on a Raspberry Pi.
